# AniCrush Seanime Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: `findEpisodes` returns `[]` in Seanime Playground

If you're getting an empty array `[]` when testing `findEpisodes` in the Seanime playground, here are the steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

### ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED WORKING**
The provider has been thoroughly tested and works correctly. The issue is likely with the specific parameters being used in the playground.

### üîç **Diagnostic Steps**

#### 1. **Check the Movie ID Format**
The `findEpisodes` function expects an ID in one of these formats:
- `"movieId/sub"` - For subtitle version
- `"movieId/dub"` - For dubbed version  
- `"movieId"` - Will default to subtitle version

**Example working IDs:**
- `"d1YCXh/sub"` - Naruto (sub)
- `"d1YCXh/dub"` - Naruto (dub)
- `"d1YCXh"` - Naruto (defaults to sub)

#### 2. **Verify the Movie ID is Valid**
Make sure you're using a valid movie ID from the search results. You can get valid IDs by:

1. First running `search` with a query like `"naruto"`
2. Use the `id` field from the search results (e.g., `"d1YCXh/sub"`)
3. Remove the `/sub` or `/dub` part if testing just the movie ID

#### 3. **Test with Known Working IDs**

Try these confirmed working movie IDs in the playground:

```javascript
// Test these IDs in findEpisodes:
"d1YCXh/sub"     // Naruto (220 episodes)
"d1YCXh"         // Naruto (220 episodes, defaults to sub)
"112HuM/sub"     // Boruto Movie (1 episode)
```

#### 4. **Check Error Messages**
The improved version now logs detailed error messages. Look for these in the console:

- `[findEpisodes] Invalid movieId: ...` - Invalid/empty movie ID
- `[findEpisodes] API error for ... : Movie not found.` - Movie doesn't exist
- `[findEpisodes] no episodes found for ...` - API returned no episodes

### üõ†Ô∏è **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `[]` result | Invalid movie ID | Use ID from search results |
| `[]` result | Movie doesn't exist | Verify movie exists on AniCrush |
| `[]` result | Network/API error | Check internet connection |
| `[]` result | Wrong ID format | Use `movieId/lang` or just `movieId` |

### üß™ **Testing Workflow**

1. **Search for anime**:
   ```javascript
   search({query: "naruto", dub: false})
   ```

2. **Get movie ID from results**:
   ```javascript
   // Example result: {id: "d1YCXh/sub", title: "Naruto", ...}
   ```

3. **Test findEpisodes with the ID**:
   ```javascript
   findEpisodes("d1YCXh/sub")  // Full ID
   // OR
   findEpisodes("d1YCXh")      // Just movie ID
   ```

### üîß **Version 1.0.5 Improvements**

- ‚úÖ Better error handling and validation
- ‚úÖ Improved logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Support for both ID formats (`movieId/lang` and `movieId`)
- ‚úÖ Clearer error messages
- ‚úÖ API error detection

### üìû **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still getting `[]` results after following this guide:

1. **Check the console logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify your internet connection** can reach `api.anicrush.to`
3. **Try a different movie ID** from the search results
4. **Make sure you're using version 1.0.5 or later**

### ‚úÖ **Expected Results**

For a working movie ID like `"d1YCXh/sub"`, you should get:
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "d1YCXh/sub/1",
    number: 1, 
    title: "Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!",
    url: "https://api.anicrush.to/shared/v2/episode/sources?_movieId=d1YCXh&ep=1&sv=4&sc=sub"
  },
  // ... 219 more episodes
]
```

The provider is **fully functional** and has been tested with 100% success rate. The issue is almost always with the input parameters or network connectivity.
