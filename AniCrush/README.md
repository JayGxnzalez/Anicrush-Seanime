## Technical Details

### Server Fallback Logic
The extension tries servers in this order:
1. **Server 4** (Primary) - Usually MegaCloud iframe
2. **Server 1** (Fallback) - Alternative MegaCloud iframe  
3. **Server 3** (Backup) - Additional server option
4. **Server 5** (Backup) - Additional server option
5. **Server 6** (Backup) - Additional server option

### Video Source Types
- **iframe**: MegaCloud embedded players (most common)
- **m3u8**: Direct HLS streams (when available)
- **mp4**: Direct video files (legacy support)

### API Compatibility
- Handles AniCrush's v2 API endpoints
- Supports grouped episode structure ("001 - 100" ranges)
- Proper error handling for unavailable servers
- Alphanumeric movie ID validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No episodes found"**
   - Ensure you're using the correct anime from search results
   - Check that the anime has episodes available on AniCrush

2. **"No working servers found"**
   - This is rare with multi-server support
   - Try a different episode or anime
   - Check AniCrush website directly

3. **Stream not loading**
   - The extension now tries multiple servers automatically
   - Check Seanime's console logs for detailed error information
   - Verify your internet connection

- Server selection process
